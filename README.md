## Introduction
## Dataset
We choose the midi file type as our way to represent music, because compared
to .mp3 or .wav files, we can easily get the information on
timestamps, duration and pitches of individual notes using
this storage format. In our program, we use the pretty midi
python model to process the midi file.
